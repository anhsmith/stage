Description: The STAGE package implements Bayesian models for estimating 
    transition points between two classes. The model developed specifically 
    in this package is the STAGE model (State Transition Analysis via Generative 
    Estimator), which fits a uniform (plateau) region and a Gaussian tail to 
    each maturity stage. Other models offered include the 'HOF' parameterisation 
    of logistic regression, and Linear Discriminant Analysis (all Bayesian). 
    The package provides functions for fitting single-population and 
    hierarchical models, extracting posterior transition points (m50), 
    producing predictions, and summarising uncertainty. The methods are 
    designed for applications such as maturity estimation and other problems 
    involving class overlap and asymmetric distributions.
